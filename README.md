# Tab Center Redux

Your favorite vertical tabbed browsing add-on, now compatible with Firefox 57+.
[Install the extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tab-center-redux/).

Some features from the [original add-on](https://github.com/bwinton/TabCenter/) are not ported yet, feel free to contribute!

## Help localize the project!
The strings to translate can be found in [src/_locales](https://github.com/eoger/tabcenter-redux/tree/master/src/_locales).
If the add-on takes off, the localization work will be moved to a dedicated platform like [Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/).

## How can I contribute?

You need to have a recent version of node.
1. Clone this repository
2. Install the dependencies with `npm i`.
3. Run `npm run dev` and start hacking!

   If you donâ€™t have Firefox Release installed, `WEB_EXT_FIREFOX=nightly npm run dev` or `WEB_EXT_FIREFOX=beta npm run dev` should work much better.

   You can load the add-on temporarily in Firefox by navigating to `about:debugging` or by using the command-line tool [web-ext](https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext).
