## How can I contribute?

You need to have a recent version of node.
1. Clone this repository
2. Install the dependencies with `npm i`.
3. Run `npm run dev` and start hacking! [Here is a list of some things](https://github.com/eoger/tabcenter-redux/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AA-P2) you could work on.

   If you don’t have Firefox Release installed, `WEB_EXT_FIREFOX=nightly npm run dev` or `WEB_EXT_FIREFOX=beta npm run dev` should work much better.
